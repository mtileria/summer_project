\begin{abstract}

  
The Interplanetary Internet is a conceived communication system designed to provide Internet-like services to space missions. Traditionally, communication in deep space was performed using point-to-point links and bespoke communication protocols, but future missions will require more communication capabilities and interoperability among participants. Communication in deep space is characterised by extremely long delays and the lack of end-to-end connectivity. Security is a principal component of interplanetary systems: resources are scarce and expensive, making unauthorised access and Denial of Service a major concern. Cryptography key management is considered one of the most difficult security problems for future space-based networks, and there is no widely accepted solution. Thus, this project aims to study the problem of key management for the Interplanetary Internet. The primary goals are to identify the fundamental differences of key management for interplanetary networks and terrestrial networks, and define the requirements for a proper solution. The secondary goals are to analyse the state-of-the-art solutions in the literature and identify the challenges that present the future Interplanetary Internet.
