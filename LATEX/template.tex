\begin{abstract}
  %The Interplanetary Internet is a conceived computer network designed to provide Internet-like services to space missions. Communications in deep space is characterised by extremely long delays and the lack of end-to-end connectivity. Communication infrastructure in deep space is scarce and unauthorised access to the them is a critical issue. In this context, the Delay/Disruption Tolerant (DTN) Architecture was defined to provide a reliable communication system for ``challenged networks''. Cryptography key management is considered the most difficult security problem for DTNs, and there is no definitive solution to this problem.
