\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}

The erly days of space exploration were characterized by relatively simple mission communicaiton requirements, specially considered todays missions. 

Telecommunication capabilities increase dramatically and it was difficult to adhere to standards as each mission try to push the state of the art. As a result, customs equipments and interfaces were the norm. 

As the internet has revolutionized terrestrial communication allowing diverse reigional networks to confederate over a backbone, the emergence of conceot indicates a similar expansion into space.  


A space DTN is a particular case of delay tolerant network. By far, is the most extreme scenario where delays could be extremely long and the communications get disrupted by the planets orbit and motion.

For interplanetary communication, the presence of celestial bodies affects the availability of links. However, contacts can be predicted with celestial mechanins.
